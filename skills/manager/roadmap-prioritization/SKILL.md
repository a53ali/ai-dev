# Roadmap Prioritization

Decide what to work on next quarter using evidence, not intuition or loudest stakeholder.

---

## Before You Score Anything

Prioritization is meaningless without answering these first:

1. **What is the team's goal this quarter?** (OKR, north star metric, or strategic bet)
2. **Who are the stakeholders and what are their key asks?**
3. **What is the capacity?** (engineers × sprints × velocity factor)
4. **What is non-negotiable?** (compliance, security, contractual commitments — park these separately)

---

## RICE Scoring

RICE is best for product features and new initiatives.

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

| Factor | Scale | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **Reach** | # users/events per quarter | How many users does this affect per quarter? |
| **Impact** | 3/2/1/0.5/0.25 | Massive/High/Medium/Low/Minimal impact on goal |
| **Confidence** | 100%/80%/50% | How confident are you in Reach and Impact estimates? |
| **Effort** | Person-weeks | Total eng effort to deliver (not just dev) |

**Example**:
```
Feature: Reduce checkout abandonment with saved addresses
Reach: 50,000 users/quarter touch checkout
Impact: 2 (high — directly reduces abandonment)
Confidence: 80% (data from A/B test in similar market)
Effort: 3 person-weeks

RICE = (50,000 × 2 × 0.8) / 3 = 26,667
```

Higher RICE = higher priority. Use relative ranking, not absolute scores.

---

## ICE Scoring

ICE is faster and works well for tech initiatives, internal tools, and engineering-led work.

```
ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease
```

| Factor | Scale | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **Impact** | 1–10 | How much does this move the needle on our goal? |
| **Confidence** | 1–10 | How sure are we it will work as expected? |
| **Ease** | 1–10 | How easy is this to implement? (10 = trivial) |

**Example**:
```
Initiative: Add distributed tracing to payment service
Impact: 7 (reduces MTTR, reduces on-call burden)
Confidence: 9 (we know this helps, team has done it before)
Ease: 5 (moderate effort, 2-week implementation)

ICE = 7 × 9 × 5 = 315
```

## Scoring Sheet Template

```markdown
## Q[N] Roadmap Scoring: [Team Name]

**Goal**: [OKR or strategic objective]
**Capacity**: [N] person-weeks available

### Scored Initiatives

| Initiative | Type | RICE/ICE Score | Effort (wks) | Cumulative Effort | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [name] | Feature/Tech/Ops | [score] | [N] | [running total] | 1 |
| [name] | | | | | 2 |
| [name] | | | | | 3 |

**Non-negotiables** (scored separately, capacity reserved first):
| Initiative | Effort | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| [compliance item] | [N weeks] | [legal/contractual] |

**Capacity after non-negotiables**: [X weeks]

### Scope Decision
| Initiative | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| [name] | In / Out / Stretch | [reason] |
```

---

## Dependency Mapping

Before finalizing the roadmap, map blockers:

```
Initiative A ──requires──> Initiative B (must ship B before A)
Initiative C ──blocks──>   Initiative D (C's output enables D)
Initiative E ──risks──>    Initiative F (E's outcome changes F's priority)
```

**Rules:**
- If an initiative has 2+ unresolved dependencies, it's likely a Q+1 item
- Surface cross-team dependencies in planning (not at execution time)
- Time-box dependency resolution: if it takes > 1 week to align, defer the initiative

---

## Portfolio Balance Check

A healthy quarterly roadmap balances across:

| Category | Target Mix | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **New capability** (user value) | 40-60% | New features, integrations |
| **Tech investment** (team health) | 20-30% | Refactoring, infra, tooling |
| **Reliability** (stability) | 10-20% | Observability, on-call reduction |
| **Maintenance** (hygiene) | 5-10% | Dependency updates, security |

If tech investment drops below 20% for 2+ quarters, expect velocity to slow and incidents to increase.

---

## Communicating Tradeoffs

When a stakeholder's request doesn't make it into the roadmap:

**Template**:
```
We evaluated [initiative] using RICE/ICE scoring.
It scored [X], which placed it at priority [N] in our ranked list.
Given our capacity of [X] weeks, we can execute priorities 1-[N].

[Initiative] is planned for Q[N+1] because:
- [reason: lower impact than items above it / blocked by dependency / capacity constrained]

To move it earlier, we would need to:
- [option A: defer initiative X (here's the tradeoff)]
- [option B: add capacity (here's the cost)]
- [option C: descope it to fit in Q[N]]

Which would you prefer?
```

This positions you as decision-enabler, not gatekeeper.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| HiPPO prioritization | Highest-paid person's opinion drives the roadmap | Score every initiative; surface the data |
| No capacity accounting | Roadmap assumes 100% eng time on features | Reserve 20% for unplanned work, on-call, reviews |
| Ignoring tech debt | 0 tech initiatives in the roadmap | Enforce portfolio balance; tech debt creates future capacity problems |
| Scope creep in planning | "Just add one more thing" | Capacity is finite; every addition needs a removal |
| Annual planning, quarterly ignoring | Plan once, never revisit | Monthly roadmap review; rescore when context changes |
